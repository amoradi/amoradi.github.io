E.g. with stocks, evaluating operating health via examining: \n\nincome statement\nbalance sheet\ncash flow statement\nin the context of long-term vision and macroeconimic exposure\nprice to earnings\nprice to sales\nbook value\nreturn on equity\n\nSell-side research for cryptoassets is non-existant/nascent. Onus is on the innovative crypto investor to do his/her own research.\nFundamental analysis for cryptoassets is different from that of stocks because cryptoassets are not necessarily companies. The asset may have been created by a company, and an understanding of that company is vital, but the cryptoassets themselves should be valued more as commodities, with markets priced by the balance of supply and demand.\nFundamental analysis for a cryptoasset performed via examining its:\n\nWhite paper\nDecentralization edge\nValuation\nCommunity and developers\nIssuance model\n\nWhite Paper\n\"Vagueness is not your friend\". If a white paper lacks specificity...avoid the asset.\n\nInvestors should feel comfortable briefly explaining the asset in some manner to a friend who may or may not be knowledgeable on the subject. If the investor can't do that, it may be appropriatee to consider a different cryptoasset.\n\nDecentralization Edge\n\nWhen reading the white paper, the first question to ask is: What problem does it solve? In other words, is there a reason for this cryptoasset and its associated architecture to exist in a decentralized manner?...does this one have an inherent benefit to being provisioned in a distributed, secure, and egalitarian manner? We call this the decentralization edge. Put bluntly by Vitalik Buterin, \"Projects really should make sure they have good answers for 'why use a blockchain.'\n\nValuation\nBroadly, there are two kinds of value that the community places on any kind of cryptoasset: utility value and speculative value.\nUtility Value and Speculative Value\nUtility refers to the use of the cryptoasset to gain access to the digital resource its architecture provisions and is dictated by supply and demand characteristics. For Bitcoin, its utility is that it can safely, quickly, and efficiently transfer value to anyone, anywhere in the world.\nFuture utility value can be thought of as speculative value.\n\nHowever, at a certain point some investors may choose to exit their investments because they feel that bitcoin has reached its maximum value. In other words, those investors no longer feel bitcoin has any speculative value left, and instead its price is only supported by current utility value.\n\n\nutility value = akin to current use value\nspeculative value = akin to future utility value\n\nTo calculate if maximum value has been reached, two concepts need to be explored: velocity of money and discounting.\nVelocity in the Context of Valuation\n\nThe velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period...it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time.\n\n\nvelocity of money = GDP for time period / total money supply\n\n\nFor example, if GDP is $20 trillion and money supply is $5 trillion, then velocity is 4. Currently, the velocity of the USD is a little north of 5.\nThe global remittances market — granting actors the ability to send money to one another internationally — is a graspable example use case of bitcoin.\n$500 billion is transmitted annually through thte remittances market. Assuming BTC serviced the entire market, then to figure out the value of BTC, one would need to assume its velocity.\n\ntotal remittance market = 500 billion\nassumed velocity of BTC = 5\nBTC supply = 21 million\n\n\nvalue of a BTC = (500 billion / 5) / 21 million = $4,762\n\n\nThis is an overly simplistic model, BTC would not service the entire remittance market. There needs to be an assumtion to the % BTC services in the remittance market. Another market BTC would have a use case, is the investable gold market. With these additive use cases for BTC, valuation is found from adding together their respective market valuations.\nDiscounting in the Context of Valuation\n\nThe next concept necessary for determining the present value of one bitcoin is discounting future values back to the present.\n\n\nDiscounting is simply the reverse of accruing interest.\n\nExample: $100 yielding 5% annually, means in 1 year you'll have $105 and in 2 years, $110.25, because you earn 5% on $105. Therefor you either want $100 now or $110.25 in 2 yrs — both are worth the same to you.\nAnalysts use the discounting method to figure how much they should pay for something now if it is expected to be worth more in the future.\nIt is easy to manipulate models to show an asset is under or overe valued, but these models are nonetheless useful to give investors some bearing on what they are paying for.\n","description":"Fundamental analysis and a valuation framework for cryptoassets","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/crypto-fundamental-analysis-and-valuation-framework/","title":"Crypto Fundamental Analysis and Valuation"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/margin-of-safety/":{"body":"Chapter 20 in The Intelligent Investor\nConfronted to distill the secret of sound investing into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY.\n\nHere the function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that of rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the margin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earnings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor to feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.\n\n\nObservation over many years has taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions.\n\n\nThe margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when we apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We have here, by definition, a favorable difference between price on the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. That difference is the safety margin.\n\nTheory of Diversification\nMargin of safety and the principle of diversification are closely and logically aligned. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor's favor, an individual security may work out badly. Margin guarantees only a better chance for profit than loss, but not that loss is impossible. As the number of positions is increased, the more certain does it become that the aggregate of profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.\n\nDiversification is an established tenet of conservative investment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demonstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which diversification is the companion.\n\nA Criterion of Investment Versus Speculation\nA true investment must have a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety can be deomonstrated \n\nby figures\nby persuasive reasoning\nby reference to a body of actual experience\n\nExtension of the Concept of Investment\n\nIt is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a security of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he practices adequate diversification. For if the price is low enough to create a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets our criterion of investment.\n\n\ninvestment opportunities, since a careful analysis would have shown that the excess of value over price provided a large margin of safety. Thus the very class of \"fair-weather investments\" which we stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naive security buyers is likely to afford many sound profit opportunities to the sophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his own price.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in Wall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles through which they have gained success in their own undertakings.\n\n\nA third business principle: \"Do not enter upon an operation—that is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable calculation shows that is has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit...operations for profit should be based not on optimism but on arithmetic.\"\n\n\nA fourth business rule is more positive: \"Have the courage of your knowledge and experiencee. If you have formed a conclusion from the fact and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—even though others may hesitate or differ.\" (You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.) Similarly, in the world of securities, courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand.\n\n","description":"The Intelligent Investor, Chapter 20...","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/margin-of-safety/","title":"\"Margin of Safety\" as the Central Concept of Investment"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/":{"body":"Chapter 8 in The Intelligent Investor\n\nLet us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want to speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will probably lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to separate it completely from your investment program.\n\nProfiting from Price Swings\n\nvia timing\n\nendeavor to anticipate the action of the stock market: to buy or hold when future course is deemed to be upward, and to sell or refrain from buying when the course is downward.\n\n\nvia pricing\n\ncompare current quote value to fair value\nendeavor to buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value and sell when they rise above such value\n\n\nA less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort to make sure that when you buy do not pay too much for you stocks. This may suffice for the defensive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no basis either in logic or in experience for assuming that any typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more successfully than the general public, of which he is himself part.\n\n\nTiming is of great psychological importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in a hurry. The idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is repugnant to him. But a waiting period, as such, is of no consequence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having his money univested until he receives some (presumably) trustworthy signal that the time has come to buy?\n\nBuy-Low-Sell-High Approach\n\nWe are convinced that the average investor cannot deal successfully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can he benefit from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying after each major decline and selling out after each major advance?\n\nThe bear, then bull, market pattern has not repeated itself over time. The most notable departure was in the late 1920's bull market. The last 20 yrs (time of writting of this book), has done the opposite. Buy-low-sell-high is considered an old, fairly regular pattern.\n\nIt seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to base present policy on the classic formula—i.e., to wait for demonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common stocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision for changes in the proportion of common stocks to bonds in the portfolio.\n\nFormula Plans\nThe investor does some selling when the market advances substantially.\n\na very large rise in the market level would result in the sale of all common-stock.\n\n\nThis approach had te double appeal of sounding logical (and conservative) and of showing excellenct results when applied retrospectively to the stock market over many years in the past.\n\n\nThe moral seems to be that any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too simple and too easy to last. Spinoza's concluding remark applies to Wall Street as well as to philosophy: \"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\"\n\nMarket Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio\n\nA serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or poorer. But what about the long-term and wider changes?\n\n\neven the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd.\n\n\nfor these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor's portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a formula will give him something to do.\n\nBusiness Valuations Versus Stock-Market Valuations\nConsider an investor's situation from the standpoint of a stockholder. The stock holder shares a kind of double status. And with it, the privilege of taking advantage of either at his choice.\n\nminority shareholder/silent partner in a private business\n\nhis results are wholly dependent on the profits of the enterprise\nor in a change in the underlying values of its assets\nvalue determined by his share of the net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheets\n\n\ncommon stock investor\n\nholds a piece of paper, the stock certificate\ncan be sold in a matter of minutes\nwhos price varies minute by minute (open market hours)\nis often far removed from the balance-sheet value\n\n\n\nThis is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing...The whole structure of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.\n\nthe better a company's record and prospects, the less relationship the share price will have to its book value\nthe greater the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of determining its intrinsic value\n\nThus we reach the final paradox, the more successful the company, the greater likelihood of fluctuations in the price of its shares. This really means, the better the quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to be.\nPurchases made at or below 1/3 above tangible-asset value, may with logic be regarded as related to the company's balance sheet, and as having justification or support independent of fluctuating market prices. Safe zone: tether buys to no more than 1/3 above tangible-asset value irrespective of market price.\nA stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset value. The investor also needs:\n\na good earnings to price ratio\nstrong financials\nthe prospect of continued, sustained or better earnings over years.\n\nThe investor with such book values behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high mulitpliers of both earning and tangible assets.\nAs long as the earning power of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can give as little attention as he pleases to the vagaries of the stock market. More than that, at times he can use these vagaries to play the master game of buying low and selling high.\nThe A. &amp; P. Example\nThe true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book.\nThis liquidity really means is:\n\nthe investor has the benefit of the stock market's daily and changing appraisal of his holdings\nthe investor is able to increase and decrease his investment at the market's daily figure if he chooses\n\nThus the existence of a quoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not have if the security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from some other source.\nSummary\nSpeculator\n\ninterest lies in anticipating and profiting from market flucuations\n\nInvestor\n\nprimary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices\nmarket movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create\n\nlow price levels at which he would be wise to buy \nhigh price levels at which he should refrain from buying and would be wise to sell\n\n\n\nAs in all other activities that emphasize price movements first and underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds constantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-defeating over the years.\n\nThe investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should always remember that market quotations are there for his convenience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ingnored. He should never buy a stock becuase it has gone up or sell one because it has gone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more simply: \"Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell one immediatley after a substantial drop\".\n\n","description":"The Intelligent Investor, Chapter 8...","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/","title":"The Investor and Market Fluctuations"}},"docInfo":{"https://amoradi.github.io/":{"body":92,"description":0,"title":0},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/crypto-fundamental-analysis-and-valuation-framework/":{"body":490,"description":5,"title":4},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/margin-of-safety/":{"body":323,"description":4,"title":5},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/":{"body":739,"description":4,"title":3}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};

When you can, it’s good to reuse an existing one instead of rolling your own\nthere’s still a good chance you’ll find yourself needing to whip up a parser or other tool when there isn’t an existing library that fits your needs\ninevitably end up needing to debug and maintain it and poke around in its guts.\n\n\nLanguages are great exercise\n\nLong distance runners sometimes train with weights strapped to their ankles or at high altitudes where the atmosphere is thin. When they later unburden themselves, the new relative ease of light limbs and oxygen-rich air enables them to run farther and faster.\nImplementing a language is a real test of programming skill.\n\nThe code is complex and performance critical.\nYou must master recursion, dynamic arrays, trees, graphs, and hash tables.\nYou probably use hash tables at least in your day-to-day programming, but do you really understand them?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Interpreter\nWe’ll write our first interpreter, jlox, in Java. The focus is on concepts. We’ll write the simplest, cleanest code we can to correctly implement the semantics of the language. \nJava is a great language for this. It’s high level enough that we don’t get overwhelmed by fiddly implementation details, but it’s still pretty explicit. Unlike in scripting languages, there tends to be less complex machinery hiding under the hood.\nI also chose Java specifically because it is an object-oriented language. While academic language folks sometimes look down on object-oriented languages, the reality is that they are widely used even for language work. GCC and LLVM are written in C++, as are most JavaScript virtual machines. Object-oriented languages are ubiquitous, and the tools and compilers for a language are often written in the same language.\nBy the end of part II, we’ll have a simple, readable implementation. It’s not very fast, but it’s correct.\nThe Second Interpreter\nSo in the next part, we start all over again, but this time in C. C is the perfect language for understanding how an implementation really works, all the way down to the bytes in memory and the code flowing through the CPU.\nA big reason that we’re using C is so I can show you things C is particularly good at, but that does mean you’ll need to be pretty comfortable with it.\nIf you aren’t there yet, pick up an introductory book on C and chew through it, then come back here when you’re done. In return, you’ll come away from this book an even stronger C programmer. That’s useful given how many language implementations are written in C: Lua, CPython, and Ruby’s MRI, to name a few.\nIn our C interpreter, clox, we are forced to implement for ourselves all the things Java gave us for free. We’ll write our own dynamic array and hash table. We’ll decide how objects are represented in memory, and build a garbage collector to reclaim them.\nOur Java implementation was focused on being correct. Now that we have that down, we’ll turn to also being fast. \nWe’ll even try our hand at benchmarking and optimization. By the end, we’ll have a robust, accurate, fast interpreter for our language, able to keep up with other professional caliber implementations out there.\nParts of a Language\nEngineers have been building programming languages since the Dark Ages of computing. As soon as we could talk to computers, we discovered doing so was too hard, and we enlisted their help. I find it fascinating that even though today’s machines are literally a million times faster and have orders of magnitude more storage, the way we build programming languages is virtually unchanged.\nThough the area explored by language designers is vast, the trails they’ve carved through it are few. Not every language takes the exact same path—some take a shortcut or two—but otherwise they are reassuringly similar.\nSteps:\n\nScanning\nTokens\nParsing\nSyntax Tree\nAnalysis\nIntermediate Representation\nCode Generation\nHigh-level language, Bytecode, Machine Code\n\nScanning\nAKA lexing, or lexical analysis. A scanner or lexer, takes in a linear stream of characters and chunks them together into a series of something akin to \"words\". Each word is called a token.\nWhite space, comments and other characters are ignored or often ignored.\nvar avg = ( min + max ) / 2 ;\nParsing\nThe next step is parsing. This is where our syntax gets a grammar. \nDid you ever diagram sentences in English class? If so, you’ve done what a parser does, except that English has thousands and thousands of “keywords” and an overflowing cornucopia of ambiguity. Programming languages are much simpler.\nA parser takes the flat sequence of tokens and builds a tree structure that mirrors the nested nature of the grammar. These trees have a couple of different names—parse tree or abstract syntax tree.\nParsing has a long, rich history in computer science that is closely tied to the artificial intelligence community. Many of the techniques used today to parse programming languages were originally conceived to parse human languages by AI researchers who were trying to get computers to talk to us.\nIt turns out human languages were too messy for the rigid grammars those parsers could handle, but they were a perfect fit for the simpler artificial grammars of programming languages\n...still we manage to use those simple grammars incorrectly, so the parser’s job also includes letting us know when we do by reporting syntax errors.\nStatic Analysis\nThe first two stages are pretty similar across all implementations. Now, the individual characteristics of each language start coming into play. At this point, we know the syntactic structure of the code—things like which expressions are nested in which—but we don’t know much more than that.\nThe first bit of analysis that most languages do is called binding or resolution: For each identifier, we find out where that name is defined and wire the two together. This is where scope comes into play.\nIf the language is statically typed, this is when we type check. Once we know where a and b are declared, we can also figure out their types. Then if those types don’t support being added to each other, we report a type error.\nNow, with a sweeping view of the user’s program, we need to store it somewhere:\n\nstored right back as attributes on the syntax tree itself—extra fields in the nodes that aren’t initialized during parsing but get filled in later.\nin a lookup table off to the side, a symbol table\ninto an entirely new data structure that more directly expresses the semantics of the code\n\nUp to this point is considererd the front end of the implementation. Next are the middle end and back end.\nIntermediate Representations\nThe front end of the pipeline is specific to the source language the program is written in. The back end is concerned with the final architecture where the program will run.\nIn the middle, the code may be stored in some intermediate representation (IR) that isn’t tightly tied to either the source or destination forms (hence “intermediate”).\n\n\nbetter cross-compilation ability. write one front end and N back ends per target. Vs, writing N compilers for each source-target combo.\n\n\nIntermediate representation also gives us better opportunity for optimization.\n\n\nOptimization\nOnce we understand what the user’s program means, we are free to swap it out with a different program that has the same semantics but implements them more efficiently—we can optimize it.\nA simple example is constant folding: if some expression always evaluates to the exact same value, we can do the evaluation at compile time and replace the code for the expression with its result.\npennyArea = 3.14159 * (0.75 / 2) * (0.75 / 2);\n\nwe could do all of that arithmetic in the compiler and change the code to:\npennyArea = 0.4417860938;\n\nOptimization is a huge part of the programming language business. Many language hackers spend their entire careers here, squeezing every drop of performance they can out of their compilers to get their benchmarks a fraction of a percent faster.\nWe’re mostly going to hop over that rathole in this book. Many successful languages have surprisingly few compile-time optimizations.\nCode Generation\nWe have applied all of the optimizations we can think of to the user’s program. The last step is converting it to a form the machine can actually run: primitive assembly-like instructions a CPU runs and not the kind of “source code” a human might want to read.\nFinally, we are in the back end.\nFrom here on out, our representation of the code becomes more and more primitive, like evolution run in reverse, as we get closer to something our simple-minded machine can understand.\nWe have a decision to make. Do we generate instructions for a real CPU or a virtual one?\nMartin Richards and Niklaus Wirth, of BCPL and Pascal fame, respectively, made their compilers produce virtual machine code. Instead of instructions for some real chip, they produced code for a hypothetical, idealized machine. Wirth called this p-code for portable, but today, we generally call it bytecode. \nThese synthetic instructions are designed to map a little more closely to the language’s semantics, and not be so tied to the peculiarities of any one computer architecture and its accumulated historical cruft. You can think of it like a dense, binary encoding of the language’s low-level operations.\nVirtual Machine\nIf your compiler produces bytecode, your work isn’t over once that’s done. Since there is no chip that speaks that bytecode, it’s your job to translate.\nAgain, you have two options. You can write a little mini-compiler for each target architecture that converts the bytecode to native code for that machine. You still have to do work for each chip you support, but this last stage is pretty simple and you get to reuse the rest of the compiler pipeline across all of the machines you support. You’re basically using your bytecode as an intermediate representation.\nOr you can write a virtual machine (VM), a program that emulates a hypothetical chip supporting your virtual architecture at runtime. Running bytecode in a VM is slower than translating it to native code ahead of time because every instruction must be simulated at runtime each time it executes. In return, you get simplicity and portability. Implement your VM in, say, C, and you can run your language on any platform that has a C compiler. This is how the second interpreter we build in this book works.\nRuntime\nWe have finally hammered the user’s program into a form that we can execute. \n\ncompiled to machine code, we simply tell the operating system to load the executable and off it goes\ncompiled to bytecode, we need to start up the VM and load the program into that.\n\nIn both cases, we usually need some services that our language provides while the program is running.\n\nif the language automatically manages memory, we need a garbage collector going in order to reclaim unused bits\nIf our language supports “instance of” tests so you can see what kind of object you have, then we need some representation to keep track of the type of each object during execution.\n\nAll of this stuff is going at runtime, so it’s called, appropriately, the runtime.\n\nIn a fully compiled language, the code implementing the runtime gets inserted directly into the resulting executable. In, say, Go, each compiled application has its own copy of Go’s runtime directly embedded in it.\nIf the language is run inside an interpreter or VM, then the runtime lives there. This is how most implementations of languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript work.\n\nShortcuts and Alernative Routes\nSingle-pass Compilers\nSome simple compilers interleave parsing, analysis, and code generation so that they produce output code directly in the parser. These single-pass compilers restrict the design of the language. You have no intermediate data structures to store global information about the program, and you don’t revisit any previously parsed part of the code. That means as soon as you see some expression, you need to know enough to correctly compile it.\nPascal and C were designed around this limitation. At the time, memory was so precious that a compiler might not even be able to hold an entire source file in memory, much less the whole program. This is why Pascal’s grammar requires type declarations to appear first in a block. It’s why in C you can’t call a function above the code that defines it unless you have an explicit forward declaration that tells the compiler what it needs to know to generate code for a call to the later function.\nTree-walk Interpreters\nSome programming languages begin executing code right after parsing it to an AST (with maybe a bit of static analysis applied).\nTranspilers\nYou write a front end for your language. Then, in the back end, instead of doing all the work to lower the semantics to some primitive target language, you produce a string of valid source code for some other language that’s about as high level as yours. \nThey used to call this a source-to-source compiler or a transcompiler. After the rise of languages that compile to JavaScript in order to run in the browser, they’ve affected the hipster sobriquet transpiler.\nAfter the viral spread of UNIX to machines various and sundry, there began a long tradition of compilers that produced C as their output language. C compilers were available everywhere UNIX was and produced efficient code, so targeting C was a good way to get your language running on a lot of architectures.\nWeb browsers are the “machines” of today, and their “machine code” is JavaScript, so these days it seems almost every language out there has a compiler that targets JS since that’s the main way to get your code running in a browser.\nThe front end—scanner and parser—of a transpiler looks like other compilers. Then, if the source language is only a simple syntactic skin over the target language, it may skip analysis entirely and go straight to outputting the analogous syntax in the destination language.\nIf the two languages are more semantically different, you’ll see more of the typical phases of a full compiler including analysis and possibly even optimization. Then, when it comes to code generation, instead of outputting some binary language like machine code, you produce a string of grammatically correct source (well, destination) code in the target language.\nEither way, you then run that resulting code through the output language’s existing compilation pipeline, and you’re good to go.\nJust-in-time Compilation\nThis last one is less a shortcut and more a dangerous alpine scramble best reserved for experts. The fastest way to execute code is by compiling it to machine code, but you might not know what architecture your end user’s machine supports. What to do?\nOn the end user’s machine, when the program is loaded—either from source in the case of JS, or platform-independent bytecode for the JVM and CLR—you compile it to native code for the architecture their computer supports. Naturally enough, this is called just-in-time compilation. Most hackers just say “JIT”, pronounced like it rhymes with “fit”.\nThe most sophisticated JITs insert profiling hooks into the generated code to see which regions are most performance critical and what kind of data is flowing through them. Then, over time, they will automatically recompile those hot spots with more advanced optimizations.\nCompilers and Interpreters\nWhat’s the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?\nIt turns out this is like asking the difference between a fruit and a vegetable. That seems like a binary either-or choice, but actually “fruit” is a botanical term and “vegetable” is culinary.\n\nCompiling is an implementation technique that involves translating a source language to some other—usually lower-level—form. \ncompiler: it translates source code to some other form but doesn’t execute it. The user has to take the resulting output and run it themselves.\ninterpreter: takes in source code and executes it immediately. It runs programs “from source”.\nCPython When you run your Python program using it, the code is parsed and converted to an internal bytecode format, which is then executed inside the VM. From the user’s perspective, this is clearly an interpreter—they run their program from source. But if you look under CPython’s scaly skin, you’ll see that there is definitely some compiling going on. The answer is that it is both. CPython is an interpreter, and it has a compiler.\n\n","description":"A Map of the Territory","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/crafting-interpreters-ch2/","title":"Crafting Interpreters, Ch. 2"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/crypto-fundamental-analysis-and-valuation-framework/":{"body":"Chapter 12 in Cryptoassets, The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond\n\nFundamental analysis will reveal if an investment is worthy of long-term capital allocation, while technical analysis will assist with the timing of buys and sells.\n\nLook at intrinsic value drivers of an asset. E.g. with stocks, evaluating operating health via examining: \n\nincome statement\nbalance sheet\ncash flow statement\nin the context of long-term vision and macroeconimic exposure\nprice to earnings\nprice to sales\nbook value\nreturn on equity\n\nSell-side research for cryptoassets is non-existant/nascent. Onus is on the innovative crypto investor to do his/her own research.\nFundamental analysis for cryptoassets is different from that of stocks because cryptoassets are not necessarily companies. The asset may have been created by a company, and an understanding of that company is vital, but the cryptoassets themselves should be valued more as commodities, with markets priced by the balance of supply and demand.\nFundamental analysis for a cryptoasset performed via examining its:\n\nWhite paper\nDecentralization edge\nValuation\nCommunity and developers\nIssuance model\n\nWhite Paper\n\"Vagueness is not your friend\". If a white paper lacks specificity...avoid the asset.\n\nInvestors should feel comfortable briefly explaining the asset in some manner to a friend who may or may not be knowledgeable on the subject. If the investor can't do that, it may be appropriatee to consider a different cryptoasset.\n\nDecentralization Edge\n\nWhen reading the white paper, the first question to ask is: What problem does it solve? In other words, is there a reason for this cryptoasset and its associated architecture to exist in a decentralized manner?...does this one have an inherent benefit to being provisioned in a distributed, secure, and egalitarian manner? We call this the decentralization edge. Put bluntly by Vitalik Buterin, \"Projects really should make sure they have good answers for 'why use a blockchain.'\n\nValuation\nBroadly, there are two kinds of value that the community places on any kind of cryptoasset: utility value and speculative value.\nUtility Value and Speculative Value\nUtility refers to the use of the cryptoasset to gain access to the digital resource its architecture provisions and is dictated by supply and demand characteristics. For Bitcoin, its utility is that it can safely, quickly, and efficiently transfer value to anyone, anywhere in the world.\nFuture utility value can be thought of as speculative value.\n\nHowever, at a certain point some investors may choose to exit their investments because they feel that bitcoin has reached its maximum value. In other words, those investors no longer feel bitcoin has any speculative value left, and instead its price is only supported by current utility value.\n\n\nutility value = akin to current use value\nspeculative value = akin to future utility value\n\nTo calculate if maximum value has been reached, two concepts need to be explored: velocity of money and discounting.\nVelocity in the Context of Valuation\n\nThe velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period...it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time.\n\n\nvelocity of money = GDP for time period / total money supply\n\n\nFor example, if GDP is $20 trillion and money supply is $5 trillion, then velocity is 4. Currently, the velocity of the USD is a little north of 5.\nThe global remittances market — granting actors the ability to send money to one another internationally — is a graspable example use case of bitcoin.\n$500 billion is transmitted annually through thte remittances market. Assuming BTC serviced the entire market, then to figure out the value of BTC, one would need to assume its velocity.\n\ntotal remittance market = 500 billion\nassumed velocity of BTC = 5\nBTC supply = 21 million\n\n\nvalue of a BTC = (500 billion / 5) / 21 million = $4,762\n\n\nThis is an overly simplistic model, BTC would not service the entire remittance market. There needs to be an assumtion to the % BTC services in the remittance market. Another market BTC would have a use case, is the investable gold market. With these additive use cases for BTC, valuation is found from adding together their respective market valuations.\nDiscounting in the Context of Valuation\n\nThe next concept necessary for determining the present value of one bitcoin is discounting future values back to the present.\n\n\nDiscounting is simply the reverse of accruing interest.\n\nExample: $100 yielding 5% annually, means in 1 year you'll have $105 and in 2 years, $110.25, because you earn 5% on $105. Therefor you either want $100 now or $110.25 in 2 yrs — both are worth the same to you.\nAnalysts use the discounting method to figure how much they should pay for something now if it is expected to be worth more in the future.\nIt is easy to manipulate models to show an asset is under or overe valued, but these models are nonetheless useful to give investors some bearing on what they are paying for.\n","description":"Fundamental analysis and a valuation framework for cryptoassets","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/crypto-fundamental-analysis-and-valuation-framework/","title":"Crypto Fundamental Analysis and Valuation"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/horizontal-scaling/":{"body":"Horizontal scaling is a strategy used to enhance the performance of the server node by adding more instances of the server to your existing pool of servers so that the load can be equally distributed.\nIn horizontal scaling, we do not change the capacity of the individual server, but we decrease the load on the server. Horizontal scalability is achieved with the help of a distributed file system, clustering, and load – balancing.\nSome of the reasons why businesses choose to scale horizontally include an increase in their I/O concurrency, need to reduce the load on existing nodes and to expand disk capacity. Horizontal-scaling is considerably easy as you can add more machines to the existing pool. It follows the partitioning of the data in which each node contains only one part of the data.\nFor example, let us consider that you have a business website. When there is growth in your business grows, there will be growth in your website traffic. This will increase the responsibility of your server and nodes. So in order to reduce this load, we can add one more server of the same capacity along with the existing server. Now with two servers, the traffic can be managed effectively.\nThe Internet has boosted the use of Horizontal Scaling. Many giant web service providers such as Google with its Gmail and YouTube, Yahoo, Facebook, eBay, Amazon, etc. are heavily utilizing horizontal scaling.\nHorizontal scaling is also known as scaling out.\nExample of horizontal scaling: Cassandra and MongoDB.\nAdvantages of Horizontal Scaling:\n\nEasily scalable tools\nSupporting linear amplifies the capacity\nEasier to run fault-tolerance\nEasy to upgrade\nBetter use of smaller systems\nCost of implementing is less expensive compared to scaling-up\nImproved resilience due to the presence of discrete, multiple systems\nInfinite Scale can use an endless number of instances to enable limitless growth\nDisadvantages of Horizontal Scaling:\nArchitectural design is highly complicated\nHigh licensing fees\nHigh utility costs such (cooling and electricity)\nBigger footprint and impact on the data center\nExtra networking equipment such as routers and switches are required\n\nVideo Comparison\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDnVSmNFX0\nCopied from: https://www.redswitches.com/blog/difference-between-horizontal-vertical-scaling\n","description":"Scaling applications","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/horizontal-scaling/","title":"Horizontal Scaling"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/javascript-module-definitions/":{"body":"CJS\n\nCJS is short for CommonJS\nNode uses CJS module format\nWill give you a copy of the imported object\nCJS will not work in the browser.

If the margin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earnings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor to feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.\n\n\nObservation over many years has taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions.\n\n\nThe margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when we apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We have here, by definition, a favorable difference between price on the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. That difference is the safety margin.\n\nTheory of Diversification\nMargin of safety and the principle of diversification are closely and logically aligned. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor's favor, an individual security may work out badly. Margin guarantees only a better chance for profit than loss, but not that loss is impossible. As the number of positions is increased, the more certain does it become that the aggregate of profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.\n\nDiversification is an established tenet of conservative investment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demonstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which diversification is the companion.\n\nA Criterion of Investment Versus Speculation\nA true investment must have a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety can be deomonstrated \n\nby figures\nby persuasive reasoning\nby reference to a body of actual experience\n\nExtension of the Concept of Investment\n\nIt is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a security of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he practices adequate diversification. For if the price is low enough to create a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets our criterion of investment.\n\n\ninvestment opportunities, since a careful analysis would have shown that the excess of value over price provided a large margin of safety. Thus the very class of \"fair-weather investments\" which we stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naive security buyers is likely to afford many sound profit opportunities to the sophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his own price.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in Wall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles through which they have gained success in their own undertakings.\n\n\nA third business principle: \"Do not enter upon an operation—that is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable calculation shows that is has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit...operations for profit should be based not on optimism but on arithmetic.\"\n\n\nA fourth business rule is more positive: \"Have the courage of your knowledge and experiencee. If you have formed a conclusion from the fact and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—even though others may hesitate or differ.\" (You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.) Similarly, in the world of securities, courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand.\n\n","description":"The Intelligent Investor, Chapter 20...","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/margin-of-safety/","title":"\"Margin of Safety\" as the Central Concept of Investment"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/":{"body":"Chapter 8 in The Intelligent Investor\n\nLet us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want to speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will probably lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to separate it completely from your investment program.\n\nProfiting from Price Swings\n\nvia timing\n\nendeavor to anticipate the action of the stock market: to buy or hold when future course is deemed to be upward, and to sell or refrain from buying when the course is downward.\n\n\nvia pricing\n\ncompare current quote value to fair value\nendeavor to buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value and sell when they rise above such value\n\n\nA less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort to make sure that when you buy do not pay too much for you stocks. This may suffice for the defensive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no basis either in logic or in experience for assuming that any typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more successfully than the general public, of which he is himself part.\n\n\nTiming is of great psychological importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in a hurry. The idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is repugnant to him. But a waiting period, as such, is of no consequence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having his money univested until he receives some (presumably) trustworthy signal that the time has come to buy?\n\nBuy-Low-Sell-High Approach\n\nWe are convinced that the average investor cannot deal successfully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can he benefit from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying after each major decline and selling out after each major advance?\n\nThe bear, then bull, market pattern has not repeated itself over time. The most notable departure was in the late 1920's bull market. The last 20 yrs (time of writting of this book), has done the opposite. Buy-low-sell-high is considered an old, fairly regular pattern.\n\nIt seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to base present policy on the classic formula—i.e., to wait for demonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common stocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision for changes in the proportion of common stocks to bonds in the portfolio.\n\nFormula Plans\nThe investor does some selling when the market advances substantially.\n\na very large rise in the market level would result in the sale of all common-stock.\n\n\nThis approach had te double appeal of sounding logical (and conservative) and of showing excellenct results when applied retrospectively to the stock market over many years in the past.\n\n\nThe moral seems to be that any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too simple and too easy to last. Spinoza's concluding remark applies to Wall Street as well as to philosophy: \"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\"\n\nMarket Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio\n\nA serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or poorer. But what about the long-term and wider changes?\n\n\neven the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd.\n\n\nfor these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor's portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a formula will give him something to do.\n\nBusiness Valuations Versus Stock-Market Valuations\nConsider an investor's situation from the standpoint of a stockholder. The stock holder shares a kind of double status. And with it, the privilege of taking advantage of either at his choice.\n\nminority shareholder/silent partner in a private business\n\nhis results are wholly dependent on the profits of the enterprise\nor in a change in the underlying values of its assets\nvalue determined by his share of the net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheets\n\n\ncommon stock investor\n\nholds a piece of paper, the stock certificate\ncan be sold in a matter of minutes\nwhos price varies minute by minute (open market hours)\nis often far removed from the balance-sheet value\n\n\n\nThis is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing...The whole structure of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.\n\nthe better a company's record and prospects, the less relationship the share price will have to its book value\nthe greater the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of determining its intrinsic value\n\nThus we reach the final paradox, the more successful the company, the greater likelihood of fluctuations in the price of its shares. This really means, the better the quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to be.\nPurchases made at or below 1/3 above tangible-asset value, may with logic be regarded as related to the company's balance sheet, and as having justification or support independent of fluctuating market prices. Safe zone: tether buys to no more than 1/3 above tangible-asset value irrespective of market price.\nA stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset value. The investor also needs:\n\na good earnings to price ratio\nstrong financials\nthe prospect of continued, sustained or better earnings over years.\n\nThe investor with such book values behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high mulitpliers of both earning and tangible assets.\nAs long as the earning power of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can give as little attention as he pleases to the vagaries of the stock market. More than that, at times he can use these vagaries to play the master game of buying low and selling high.\nThe A. &amp; P. Example\nThe true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book.\nThis liquidity really means is:\n\nthe investor has the benefit of the stock market's daily and changing appraisal of his holdings\nthe investor is able to increase and decrease his investment at the market's daily figure if he chooses\n\nThus the existence of a quoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not have if the security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from some other source.\nSummary\nSpeculator\n\ninterest lies in anticipating and profiting from market flucuations\n\nInvestor\n\nprimary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices\nmarket movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create\n\nlow price levels at which he would be wise to buy \nhigh price levels at which he should refrain from buying and would be wise to sell\n\n\n\nAs in all other activities that emphasize price movements first and underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds constantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-defeating over the years.\n\nThe investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should always remember that market quotations are there for his convenience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ingnored. He should never buy a stock becuase it has gone up or sell one because it has gone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more simply: \"Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell one immediatley after a substantial drop\".\n\n","description":"The Intelligent Investor, Chapter 8...","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/","title":"The Investor and Market Fluctuations"},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/vertical-scaling/":{"body":"Vertical Scaling is an attempt to increase the capacity of a single machine. Here the resources such as processing power, storage, memory, and more are added to an existing work unit.\nVertical Scaling is done to increase the capacity of existing hardware or software by adding resources. It can enhance your server without manipulating your code. But it is limited by the fact that you can only get as big as the size of the server.\nFor example, let us consider that you have a business website. As your business grows, your website traffic will also increase. At times, with the increasing traffic, your server performance starts degrading. To manage the traffic load, your website needs to scale its resources by adding faster CPU Processors, RAM, disk capacity, etc. In such cases, you use a vertical scaling model that can enhance the capabilities of the same server and node.\nVertical Scaling boosts the power of the individual server to handle the increasing load.

This may suffice for the defensive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no basis either in logic or in experience for assuming that any typical or average investor can anticipate market movements more successfully than the general public, of which he is himself part.\n\n\nTiming is of great psychological importance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in a hurry. The idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is repugnant to him. But a waiting period, as such, is of no consequence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having his money univested until he receives some (presumably) trustworthy signal that the time has come to buy?\n\nBuy-Low-Sell-High Approach\n\nWe are convinced that the average investor cannot deal successfully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can he benefit from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying after each major decline and selling out after each major advance?\n\nThe bear, then bull, market pattern has not repeated itself over time. The most notable departure was in the late 1920's bull market. The last 20 yrs (time of writting of this book), has done the opposite. Buy-low-sell-high is considered an old, fairly regular pattern.\n\nIt seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to base present policy on the classic formula—i.e., to wait for demonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common stocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision for changes in the proportion of common stocks to bonds in the portfolio.\n\nFormula Plans\nThe investor does some selling when the market advances substantially.\n\na very large rise in the market level would result in the sale of all common-stock.\n\n\nThis approach had te double appeal of sounding logical (and conservative) and of showing excellenct results when applied retrospectively to the stock market over many years in the past.\n\n\nThe moral seems to be that any approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be easily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too simple and too easy to last. Spinoza's concluding remark applies to Wall Street as well as to philosophy: \"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\"\n\nMarket Fluctuations of the Investor's Portfolio\n\nA serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or poorer. But what about the long-term and wider changes?\n\n\neven the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd.\n\n\nfor these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor's portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a formula will give him something to do.\n\nBusiness Valuations Versus Stock-Market Valuations\nConsider an investor's situation from the standpoint of a stockholder. The stock holder shares a kind of double status. And with it, the privilege of taking advantage of either at his choice.\n\nminority shareholder/silent partner in a private business\n\nhis results are wholly dependent on the profits of the enterprise\nor in a change in the underlying values of its assets\nvalue determined by his share of the net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheets\n\n\ncommon stock investor\n\nholds a piece of paper, the stock certificate\ncan be sold in a matter of minutes\nwhos price varies minute by minute (open market hours)\nis often far removed from the balance-sheet value\n\n\n\nThis is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing...The whole structure of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.\n\nthe better a company's record and prospects, the less relationship the share price will have to its book value\nthe greater the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of determining its intrinsic value\n\nThus we reach the final paradox, the more successful the company, the greater likelihood of fluctuations in the price of its shares. This really means, the better the quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to be.\nPurchases made at or below 1/3 above tangible-asset value, may with logic be regarded as related to the company's balance sheet, and as having justification or support independent of fluctuating market prices. Safe zone: tether buys to no more than 1/3 above tangible-asset value irrespective of market price.\nA stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset value. The investor also needs:\n\na good earnings to price ratio\nstrong financials\nthe prospect of continued, sustained or better earnings over years.\n\nThe investor with such book values behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high mulitpliers of both earning and tangible assets.\nAs long as the earning power of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can give as little attention as he pleases to the vagaries of the stock market. More than that, at times he can use these vagaries to play the master game of buying low and selling high.\nThe A. &amp; P. Example\nThe true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book.\nThis liquidity really means is:\n\nthe investor has the benefit of the stock market's daily and changing appraisal of his holdings\nthe investor is able to increase and decrease his investment at the market's daily figure if he chooses\n\nThus the existence of a quoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not have if the security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current quotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from some other source.\nSummary\nSpeculator\n\ninterest lies in anticipating and profiting from market flucuations\n\nInvestor\n\nprimary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices\nmarket movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create\n\nlow price levels at which he would be wise to buy \nhigh price levels at which he should refrain from buying and would be wise to sell\n\n\n\nAs in all other activities that emphasize price movements first and underlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds constantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-defeating over the years.\n\nThe investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should always remember that market quotations are there for his convenience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ingnored. He should never buy a stock becuase it has gone up or sell one because it has gone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more simply: \"Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell one immediatley after a substantial drop\".\n\n","description":"The Intelligent Investor, Chapter 8...","id":"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/","title":"The Investor and Market Fluctuations"}},"docInfo":{"https://amoradi.github.io/":{"body":92,"description":0,"title":0},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/":{"body":0,"description":0,"title":0},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/margin-of-safety/":{"body":1,"description":4,"title":5},"https://amoradi.github.io/notes/the-investor-and-market-fluctuations/":{"body":735,"description":4,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};

        <h2 id="1-1-the-basic-of-statistics">1.1 The Basic of Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Statistics</strong>
The science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make decisions.</p>
<p>An <strong>individual</strong> refers to a person or object of interest. The collecton of all individuals to be studied is called a <strong>population</strong>. A <strong>sample</strong> is a subset of the population being studied.</p>
<p>A <strong>parameter</strong> is a numerical summary of a <strong>population</strong>.
A <strong>statistic</strong> is a numerical summary of a <strong>sample</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Inferential Statistics</strong> 
Is the process of taking a result from a sample and extending it to the population sampled from while measuring the reliability of the result.</p>
<p>It is often the case that time, money, and resources limit the ability of a researcher to collect data. In these cases, the researcher might consider sampling from the population.</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive Statistcs</strong>
Involves the organizing and summarizing of data. Some common tools in the process are tables, graphs, and numberical summaries.</p>
<p>It is a very important aspect of research, as it allows us to get an overview of what the data is telling us.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-of-statistics">The Process of Statistics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify the research objective.</li>
<li>Collect the information needed to answer the research objective.</li>
<li>Describe the data.</li>
<li>Perform inference.</li>
<li>Measure the reliability of the inference.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-2-data-classification">1.2 Data Classification</h2>
<p><strong>Qualitative (or categorical) variables</strong> are variables whose possible values represent 
categories, labels, etc. that are not numerical measures of counts.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative variables</strong> are variables whose possible values are numerical measurements or counts.</p>
<p>A variable is at the <strong>nominal level of measurement</strong> if the possible values of the variable represent names, labels, or categories that don't have a meaningful rank or order.</p>
<p>A variable is at the <strong>ordinal level of measurement</strong> if the possible values of the variable represent names, labels, or categories and have a meaningufl rank or order.</p>
<p>When the value of zero means the absence of the quantity, we have an <strong>inherent zero</strong>.</p>
<p>A variable is at the <strong>interval level measurement</strong> if the values of variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a meaningful order</li>
<li>Meaningful difference between values</li>
<li>A value of zero does not mean the absence of the quantity. In this case, we say that the value of zero is not an <strong>inherent zero</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A variable is at the <strong>ratio level of measurement</strong> if the values of the variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a meaningful order,</li>
<li>Meaningful difference between values,</li>
<li>The value of zero is an <strong>inherent zero</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A quantitative variable is <strong>discrete</strong> if its possible values can be listed.</p>
<p>A quantitative variable is <strong>continuous</strong> if its possible values cannot be listed.</p>

<h2 id="1-3-simple-random-sampling">1.3 Simple Random Sampling</h2>
<p><strong>Frame</strong>: a list of all individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Simple random sampling</strong> occurs when every sample of size n from a population of size N is equally likely to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling with replacement</strong> occurs when each individual selected from the population is put back in the population before the next selection (and so could be potentially included in the sample more than once.)</p>
<p><strong>Sampling without replacement</strong> occurs when each individual selected from the population is removed from the population before the next selection so that the individual cannot be included in the sample more than once.</p>
<h2 id="1-4-other-sampling-methods">1.4 Other Sampling Methods</h2>
<p><strong>Convenience sampling</strong> is a sampling technique where subjects are selected because of their convenient accessibility to the researcher.</p>
<p>This sampling technique is very popular because it is fast, inexpensive, and easy to do. Unfortunately, studies that use convenience sampling generally cannot be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>Stratified sampling</strong> is a sampling technique where the population is separated into disjoint (non-overlapping) groups called <strong>strata</strong>, and then a <strong>simple random sample from each stratum</strong> is obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster sampling</strong> is a sampling technique where the population is separated into disjoint groups, <strong>a simple random sample of groups are selected</strong>, and, <strong>every individual or a random sample of individuals</strong> within the <strong>selected groups</strong> are observed.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic sampling</strong> is a sampling technique where every kth individual in the population is selected after some random start. Usually, the random start is determined by selecting a random number between 1 and k.</p>
<h2 id="1-5-sample-bias">1.5 Sample Bias</h2>
<p>If the sample is not representative of the population, then the sample has <strong>bias</strong>...if the sampling technique used <strong>tends to favor one part of the population over another</strong>, then we have <strong>sampling bias</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Nonresponse bias</strong> occurs when individuals in the sample do not respond to the survey.</p>
<p><strong>Response bias</strong> occurs when the response of an individual in the sample does not reflect the true feelings of the individual. </p>
